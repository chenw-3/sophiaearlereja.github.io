    <p>Sophia is very efficient and consistent in sealing a deal! Good realtor! </br> - <em>R.Lumsden</em></P> </br>
    <p>Sophia Earle is an extraordinary agent. I can always call or message her and she answers with such warmth and alway provide an update whether she readily have the information or she needs to seek it. I called her once and she was
        overseas and that posed no challenge for her in providing me with information I needed. Purchasing my first home and
        having Miss Earle as my agent is a remarkable experience and I will recommend her to anyone seeking real estate and
        wants to have an Agent that's ready to go above and beyond to assist with a smile as well as bursting with a wealth of
        knowledge about the industry. Ms. Earle, I thank you and continue the great work you are doing!!!! </br> - <em>T.Williams</em></P> </br>
    <p>I contacted Sophia because I had a property to sell in Jamaica. I was unsure of where to start and wondered if I had to
        travel to Jamaica to at least start the process. I was relieved to know that all I had to do was to give her the address
        and the key. She did everything. I was updated regularly and my messages were responded to promptly. I have no regrets
        and would definitely use Sophia again. </br> - <em>D.Coley</em></p>
